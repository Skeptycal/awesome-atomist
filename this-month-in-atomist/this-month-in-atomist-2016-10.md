### Less Privilege

The Atomist team decided to reduce the default scope down to public_repo only. when requesting permissions for the atomist-bot.
Previously permissions were required for private repos. This has made several people quite happy.

### GitHub Integrations

The Atomist team is busy working on support for a recent GitHub feature called integrations:  https://developer.github.com/early-access/integrations/

To quote Jim Clark

> Integrations provide GitHub owners with a lot more control over granting access rights than the OAuth application.  They are also particularly interesting because:

> 1.  they can be "installed" into single GitHub organizations.  Contrast this with an Oauth app that always runs as a particular user.  Integrations run as the integration.  :slightly_smiling_face:

> 2.  since the integration has it's own identity, it appears as it's own bot-style "user".  A PR from an Atomist integration appears to come from ... Atomist.  

> 3.  integrations do NOT take up a license seat in a paid GitHub account.  Contrast this with inviting an external collaborator!  GitHub is providing a great way to charge only for your human collaborators :slightly_smiling_face:
 
### CLI on the way

Additional workflows are being catered for. To quote David Dooling

> The flow for creating and publishing editors/generators is part of the command-line interface which we will be releasing soon.
